# FORGE Extensions

**Optional capabilities that enhance FORGE projects.**

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Canonical Reference

## What Are Extensions?

FORGE Extensions are optional capabilities that projects may adopt to address specific needs. They are:

- **Optional** — No extension is required for FORGE compliance
- **Self-contained** — Each extension has clear adoption criteria and boundaries
- **Additive** — Extensions enhance FORGE; they do not replace core methodology

---

## Available Extensions

| Extension | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| [FORGE AI Interface (FAI)](./fai-overview.md) | AI interface layer for Q&A, actions, feedback capture, and multimodal intake | Available |

---

## Adopting an Extension

1. Review the extension overview document
2. Confirm your project meets adoption criteria
3. Add the extension's constitutional document to your project
4. Configure per the extension's guidance
5. Document adoption in your project's `CLAUDE.md`

## Extension Principles

### 1. Extensions Are Optional

No project is "less FORGE" for not adopting an extension. Extensions exist for projects with specific needs.

### 2. Extensions Have Clear Boundaries

Each extension documents:
- What it does
- What it does NOT do
- When to adopt
- When NOT to adopt

### 3. Extensions Don't Break Core

Extensions may add capabilities but never override:
- The Five Laws
- The Five Macro-Steps (F-O-R-G-E)
- Constitutional document hierarchy
- Human greenlight requirements

## Proposing New Extensions

Extensions must:
1. Address a recurring need across multiple projects
2. Have clear boundaries (not feature creep)
3. Be optional (not a gateway to mandatory complexity)
4. Have been tested in at least one real project
