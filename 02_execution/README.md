# Execution Evidence

**Real-world testing that validates (or invalidates) FORGE assumptions**

---

## What This Is

This folder contains **execution evidence** — not canonical doctrine.

FORGE methodology claims to be execution-derived. These documents prove it by showing:
- What we tested
- What worked
- What failed
- What we learned

## Relationship to Canon

| Folder | Authority | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `core/` | Canonical | What FORGE *is* |
| `02_execution/` | Evidence | What FORGE *has tested* |

Execution evidence informs but does not override canon.
