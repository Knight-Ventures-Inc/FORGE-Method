# Experiments

**In-progress or proposed tests that haven't been validated yet**

---

## What This Is

This folder contains experiments that are:
- **Proposed** — Ideas for testing that haven't started
- **In Progress** — Active testing, results pending
- **Inconclusive** — Testing completed but results unclear

Once validated, experiments graduate to `../recons/` as formal recon reports.

## Proposing an Experiment

When complete:
1. Update status to `Validated`
2. Move to `../recons/`
3. Update the recons README index
