# Project Genesis — Quick Start Guide

**How to Use the Permanent FORGE Frame Engine**

**Version:** 1.0  
**For:** Leo (and future agents who need orientation)

## What Project Genesis Is

Project Genesis is the **permanent front door** for all Knight Ventures initiatives. It's not tied to any single project — it's where every idea begins its journey through FORGE.

**Genesis does exactly four things, always in order:**

```
1. EXPLORE  →  Ideation, options, tradeoffs
2. VALIDATE →  Perplexity briefs when needed
3. FRAME    →  Produce Frame Artifact
4. PACKAGE  →  Handoff packet to CP
```

**Genesis never:**
- Creates repositories or folder structures
- Writes constitutional documents (that's CP)
- Manages execution (that's CC)
- Talks to Cursor

## The End-to-End Flow

```
Your idea (spoken, messy, partial)
         ↓
   Project Genesis
   (Explore → Validate → Frame → Package)
         ↓
   Frame Artifact (you approve)
         ↓
   CP Handoff Packet
         ↓
   Claude Project (CP creates constitutional docs)
         ↓
   You approve specs
         ↓
   CC on iMac Pro (Execute)
         ↓
   Cursor (Implementation)
```

No branching. No ambiguity. No duplicated context.

## How to Start a New Idea

Just describe it. Genesis will:

1. **Assume Explore mode** — No artifacts yet, just thinking together
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — Only what's needed to reduce ambiguity
3. **Surface 2-3 options** — With pros/cons/tradeoffs, not solutions
4. **Wait for your signal** — No artifacts until you're ready

**Trigger phrases Genesis listens for:**

| You say... | Genesis does... |
|------------|-----------------|
| "Let's explore..." | Stays in Explore mode |
| "Research this" | Creates Perplexity brief |
| "Let's lock this down" | Moves to Frame |
| "Ready to frame" | Produces Frame Artifact |
| "Hand this to CP" | Creates handoff packet |

---

## Running Multiple Ideas

Genesis can hold **multiple parallel ideas** at different stages:

- Idea A might be in Explore
- Idea B might be ready to Frame
- Idea C might be waiting for Perplexity results

Just reference which idea you're working on. Genesis maintains context for all of them.

**Tip:** Start messages with the project name when switching: *"Back to RecallTech — where were we?"*

---

## What You Get at Each Stage

### After Explore
- Clarified problem statement
- 2-3 strategic options with tradeoffs
- Identified assumptions to validate
- Clear sense of direction

### After Validate
- Perplexity research findings
- Validated vs. assumed items documented
- Risk factors identified
- Data to support Frame decisions

### After Frame
- Complete Frame Artifact (Leo-approved)
- Locked scope (IN and OUT)
- Measurable success criteria
- Open questions documented

### After Package
- CP Handoff Packet containing:
  - Frame Artifact
  - Project metadata
  - Constitutional docs needed
  - Key context and decisions
  - Open questions for CP

---

## Approval Checkpoints

Genesis will **always** ask for explicit approval at:

| Checkpoint | What You're Approving |
|------------|----------------------|
| End of Explore | "Ready to validate or frame?" |
| End of Validate | "Research sufficient, ready to frame?" |
| Frame Artifact | "Approve this Frame Artifact?" |
| Handoff Packet | "Ready to send to CP?" |

**Default:** Genesis does NOT assume approval. When in doubt, it asks.

## Quick Commands

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| "New idea: [description]" | Starts fresh Explore |
| "Options for [topic]" | Gets 2-3 strategic options |
| "Perplexity brief for [topic]" | Creates research prompt |
| "Frame this" | Produces Frame Artifact |
| "Package for CP" | Creates handoff packet |
| "Status" | Shows all active ideas and their stages |
| "Back to [project name]" | Resumes previous idea |

---

## What Lives in Genesis (Always Loaded)

**Foundational (never re-explained):**
- FORGE Core Essentials
- Agent Roles & Handoffs

**Operational (used constantly):**
- Jordan Strategist Operating Guide
- Frame Artifact Template
- CP Handoff Packet Template

Genesis assumes this knowledge. You don't need to re-explain FORGE.

---

## Troubleshooting

| If Genesis... | Do this... |
|---------------|------------|
| Jumps to solutions | Say "stay in Explore" |
| Creates artifacts too early | Say "not ready to frame yet" |
| Asks too many questions | Say "let's move forward with what we have" |
| Loses context on an idea | Say "recap [project name]" |
| Suggests a new GPT project | Remind: "Genesis is the permanent workspace" |

---

## The Golden Rule

**Genesis transforms messy ideas into clean handoffs.**

It doesn't build. It doesn't execute. It doesn't manage.

It **frames** — and that's the hardest part done right.
