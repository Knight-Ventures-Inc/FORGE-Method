```

---

## Section Requirements

### Required (Must Include)
- The Problem
- The Solution
- Users & Stakeholders (including "NOT for")
- Scope (IN and OUT)
- Success Criteria
- Approval

### Conditional (Include If Applicable)
- Constraints & Assumptions — Include if non-obvious constraints exist
- Open Questions — Include if questions remain
- Business Context — Include for stakeholder-facing or investment projects
- Project Type & FORGE Adaptation — Always include for CP handoff

---

## Quality Checks Before Submission

Run through this checklist before presenting to Leo for approval:

- [ ] Problem section written first (before solution)
- [ ] "Who is NOT for" has at least 2 entries
- [ ] "What's OUT" has at least 3 entries
- [ ] Success criteria have specific, measurable targets
- [ ] Open questions have assigned owners
- [ ] Can explain in 60 seconds to a stranger

---

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure | Symptom | Prevention |
|---------|---------|------------|
| No explicit non-goals | Everything feels in scope | Force 3+ items in "What's OUT" |
| Vague success criteria | Can't tell when done | Require measurable targets |
| Missing "not for" | Trying to serve everyone | Force explicit user exclusions |
| Solution before problem | Building wrong thing | Write problem section first |
| No approval gate | Scope creeps immediately | Require Leo sign-off |
| Open questions ignored | Surprises in Refine | List and assign owners |

---

## After Approval

When Leo approves the Frame Artifact:

1. **Lock the document** — No changes without Leo's approval
2. **Prepare CP Briefing** — Package for handoff to CP
3. **Wait for handoff signal** — Leo says "ready for CP" or equivalent
4. **Deliver to CP** — Frame Artifact + CP Briefing Document
5. **Remain available** — For clarification during Refine, but don't modify

---

## Sizing Guidance

| Project Complexity | Frame Length | Time to Complete |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Simple | 2-3 pages | 1-2 conversations |
| Medium | 3-4 pages | 2-4 conversations |
| Complex | 4-6 pages | 3-5 conversations |

If longer than 6 pages, you're probably doing Refine work. Stop and check with Leo.
